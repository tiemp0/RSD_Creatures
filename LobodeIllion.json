This requires an Athletics check against the creature's Fortitude DC. On a success, the creature becomes drained 1, and the Lobo de Illion regains **5** HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the creature, but it increases the creature's drained condition value by 1. The target creature's drained condition value decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a successful DC **14** Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes."}],"morespells":[],"alignment":"n","size":"medium","type":"aberration","adjust":0,"description":"","items":"","spellattack":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"spelldc":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"savenote":"","creature":"","speed":"25 ft","imgurl":"https://images-ng.pixai.art/images/thumb/12f66040-1c5b-405b-9f59-2acdaac32d7a","spelltype":"","focuspoints":0,"cantriplevel":"","ritualtype":"","rituals":"","spells":["","","","","","","","","","",""],"constant":"","minprof":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"strength":{"value":3,"benchmark":"high","note":""},"dexterity":{"value":-1,"benchmark":"low","note":""},"constitution":{"value":2,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"intelligence":{"value":-2,"benchmark":"low","note":""},"wisdom":{"value":0,"benchmark":"low","note":""},"charisma":{"value":0,"benchmark":"low","note":""},"perception":{"value":2,"benchmark":"low","note":"Darkvision"},"acrobatics":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"arcana":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"athletics":{"value":4,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"crafting":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"deception":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"diplomacy":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"intimidation":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"medicine":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"nature":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"occultism":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"performance":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"religion":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"society":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"stealth":{"value":5,"benchmark":"high","note":""},"survival":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"thievery":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"lore":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"lore"},"lorealt":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"lore"},"ac":{"value":12,"benchmark":"low","note":""},"hp":{"value":9,"benchmark":"high","note":""},"fortitude":{"value":8,"benchmark":"high","note":""},"reflex":{"value":5,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"will":{"value":5,"benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"resistance":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"weakness":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"immunity":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"roadmap":"brute","info":"","strikes":[{"id":"_1y5gq2lc3c0","name":"Tentacle","traits":"unarmed, backstabber, reach (10 ft)","attack":4,"damage":"1d6+1 piercing","type":"Melee"},{"id":"_26mpqftp9np","name":"Bite","traits":"unarmed, agile","attack":8,"damage":"1d4+1 piercing","type":"Melee"}]}
